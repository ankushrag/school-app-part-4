        so we kindly ask the students to put their tray on the conveyor belt provided rather than stack them up one by one. Since we 
        created that policy everything has been so efficient and less tiring for our poor catering staff that work super hard for the 
        whole day. Not only that but our every day lunch is two hot meat options, onevegan/vegetarian option and one pasta/potato section
        plus a full salad bar with soup. Not only lunch but we also provide a full breakfast for the children followed by a snack at 
        break-time called tuck shop where you pay for snacks like crisps and pizza etc.</p>

      <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Our IOAMS(Implemented Online Attendance Mangement System) helps
        To track the attendance of the specific student and see if he is skipping to often or leaving on half days quite often. Why is your 
        attendance so important? It gives us an overview of how much the child likes the school, for example, if the child comes to school 
        often it shows us that they like the school to an extent, contrasting to if the child doesn't come to school very often it gives us
        an overview they MIGHT not get on very well there or they get quite sick very often etc. Since we have very high standards and are 
        one of the top schools in the country we highly encourage our pupils to have an outstanding attendance record when they join the school 
        they start to age and start going into their GCSEs and A-Levels some of them try not to miss too many lessons and days coming to school 
        whereas other students try to stay home as long as they can and use that time to revise from whatever recourses they have whhich also we 
        highly respect as long as they thrive to their highest extent.
